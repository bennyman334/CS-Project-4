FlightManager::load_flight_data()

If N is the total number of flights in the data base and F is the average number of flights associated with each airport
The time complexity complexity will be roughly: O(NlogF)


FlightManager::find_flights()

If F is the average number of flights associated with each airport
The time complexity will be rougly: O(FlogF)
